# Task 1

## 1.

The transient phase is about 150-200 seconds long

## 2.

About 10 seconds 

## 3.

Around 300-400 seconds


## 4.

For the system we want the steady state solution and therefore need to throw away the transient phase. Looking at the graph we see that only a small amount of samples need to be thrown (10).
